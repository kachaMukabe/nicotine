## Nicotine
#### A python cli youtube manager

---

Nicotine is a cli built for interacting with youtube

### Description
---
I built this little tool to help me cut out my youtube addiction. Instead of constantly refreshing or scrolling the feed or getting distracted by recommendations in the side-bar I can now control everything from my terminal.

Select a video from your terminal and the video is streamed on iina(and possibly vlc I haven't tested that yet)

####Todo

- Enhanced search of youtube
- Ability to fav a video
- Adding inmemory database to store a browsing/watching session
